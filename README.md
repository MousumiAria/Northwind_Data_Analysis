<h1> <align="center">Northwind Data Analysis</h1>
 
The Northwind database is a sample database originally created by Microsoft and is used as tutorial purpose. 
It has various sample schemas and as well as data for entities like 
* Customer
* Product
* Order
* Employee
* Supplier
* Order Details
and many more.

In this Project I have analyzed data of several entities and gained meaningfull insight from it. 
In order to do so I used three approches.

## Approach1: Using PowerBI for data analysis and visualization: 
![Northwind Data Analysis](https://github.com/MousumiAria/Northwind_Data_Analysis/blob/main/PowerBI_Northwind.png?raw=true)
 
Here I assumed the user already got hold of the datasets and doesn't have the necessary permission to connect the database server.
I loaded the datasets(csv files) in PowerBI and used the Power Query Editor to clean, preprocess the data. Then I created the
relationship between the datasets to prepare the datamodel. In order to get the KPIs like Total Sales, Total Shipping Fee
I utlized the DAX expressions. The different charts incorporated in the dashboard provides insight mainly on sales based on the following

*  Sales for each product Category.
*  Sales for Individual Products.
*  Sales for each Month 
*  Sales for a City 

The filters introduced in dashboard further narrows down and provides more specific results.

## Approach 2: Using SQL queries for data analysis:
Details needs to be added.

## Approach 3. Using Python and Pandas for data analysis:
Details needs to be added.

## Used Language and Libraries:

* PowerBI
* Python
* Pandas 
* SQL
* MySQL Workbench
