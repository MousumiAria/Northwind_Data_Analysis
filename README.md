<h1> <align="center">Northwind Data Analysis</h1>
 
The Northwind database is a sample database originally created by Microsoft and is used as tutorial purpose. 
It has various sample schemas as well as data for entities like 
1. Customer
2. Product
3. Order
4. Employee
5. Supplier
6. Order Details
and many more.

In this Project I have analyzed data of several entities and gained meaningfull insight from it. 
In order to do so I used three approches.

## Approach1: Using PowerBI for data analysis and visualization: 
Here I assumed the user already got hold of the datasets and doesn't have the necessary permission to connect the database server.
I loaded the datasets(csv files) in PowerBI and used the Power Query Editor to clean, preprocess the data. Then I created the
relationship between the datasets to prepare the datamodel. In order to get the KPIs like Total Sales, Total Shipping Fee
I utlized the DAX expressions. The different charts incorporated in the dashboard provides insight mainly on sales based on the following

*  Sales for each product Category.
*  Sales for Individual Products.
*  Sales for each Month 
*  Sales for a City 

The filters introduced in dashboard further narrow down and provides more specific results.

## Approach 2: Using SQL queries in for data analysis:
Details needs to be added.

## Approach 3. Using Python and Pandas for data analysis:
Details needs to be added.

## Used Language and Libraries:

* PowerBI
* Python
* Pandas 
* SQL
* MySQL Workbench
